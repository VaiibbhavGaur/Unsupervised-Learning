# Unsupervised-Learning
This repository contains the work related to Unsupervised learning.

# Description

Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in data. It is used to draw inferences from data sets consisting of input data without labeled responses. 

This repository is about clustering techniques and dimension reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis.
