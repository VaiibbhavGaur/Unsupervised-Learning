# Technical Support Data Analysis using KMeans Clustering
-----------------------------------
Technical support data can often be a rich source of information on opportunities for improving customer experience or CSAT ratings. The lesser the trouble customers have with the product the better. Even better when the customers are able to overcome technical challenge quickly with minimal effort. Let us analyze the tech support data and do some basic analysis on problem types, time to resolve the problem and channel of suppor that is most suitable

## Features of the dataset
**PROBLEM_TYPE**  :              ***object***  : Test description of the problem  
**no_of_cases** :                ***int64***  : Count for the number of time the problem has occurred in unit of time.      
**Avg_pending_calls** :        ***float64***  : Average of time for pending calls.  
**Avg_resol_time**  :             ***int64***  : Resolution time average taken normally.  
**recurrence_freq** :          ***float64***  : Frequency of the problem occurring.  
**Replace_percent** :          ***float64***  : How many of them require replacement.  
**In_warranty_percent** :        ***int64***  : Percentage of time it occurs in warranty period or not.  
**Post_warranty_percent** :      ***int64***  : Percent of time it occurs after warranty period is over.
